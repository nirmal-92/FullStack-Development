<h2><u><i> FROM A SMALL CREW TO COUNTRY'S RENOWED HOTSHOT CREW :</i></u></h2>


<font size = "5">\
<p>Originally founded in 2001 as a fuels mitigation crew, they were later formed into Crew 7, a Type II IA hand-crew in 2004, and eventually transitioned into a Type I Inter-agency hotshot crew in 2008. Even after saving 500 hectres of valuable wildlife, they were not recoganized as a hotshot of their county. After a few years, Eric calls his friend <b>DUANE</b> who was a former fire chief to help them get certified as a Hotshot crew. They are trying to become the first municipal hotshot crew in the US as most are at a state or federal level.</p>
<p>Duane gets Eric and the crew an audition to become a hotshot crew, and while they’re out fighting a fire, Eric decides to stop a fire that the auditor questions. They get into an argument, and Eric sticks to his guns, and it works. But he’s worried he upset the auditor and might not pass their audition. But with Leadership, Intelligence and the ability of the crew to put out dangerous wildfires, the Auditor considered them as a Hotshot crew. They called themselves as <b><u>THE GRANITE MOUNTAIN HOTSHOTS</u></b>.</p>

<p> The Yarnell Hill Fire was a wildfire near Yarnell, Arizona, ignited by dry lightning on June 28, 2013. On June 30, it overran and killed 19 members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots.  The Yarnell Hill Fire is the sixth-deadliest American firefighter disaster in history, the deadliest wildfire ever in the state of Arizona.<p>
<p> The only survivor from the 20-man crew was 21-year-old Brendan McDonough. He had been serving as a lookout when the fire threatened to overtake his position. McDonough contacted the Granite Mountain Hotshots' team by radio to let them know of his situation. He was told by the second in command, Jesse Steed, to evacuate his position. At approximately 4:42 p.m., the fire overtook the Granite Mountain Hotshots position. When a helicopter was able to fly into the area over two hours later, Eric Tarr, a police officer–paramedic with the Arizona Department of Public Safety went in on foot and found the 19 bodies.</p>
<p> After hearing the news from a service walki takie, he can't able to control his tears and was unable to console his brother family. He said at the funeral of his brothers that, <b>"IT IS NO LONGER THE GUILT OF SURVIVING THAT I CARRY WITH ME, BUT THE HONOR OF KNOWING MY BROTHERS AS YOU KNOW THEM, AS HEROES."</b>
<p> Now, Brendan McDonough is staying happily with his wife and daughter and he is also taking care of his brother's family. The government of the US ordered the fire department to take a survey on the Granite Mountain Hotshots rescue operations. After the inspection, they defended thousands of acres of National Wildlands, protected countless homes and saved lives all across the United States.</p> </font size = "5">
